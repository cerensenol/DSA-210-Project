# The Path to Crime
## Overview
This project examines the relationship between the use of drugs and crime rates in the context of the role plated by untreated mental ilnesses in the use of drugs.

## Motivation
It is hard to understand why people turn to crime. Mental illnesses often go undiagnosed and many people self-medicate with drugs; leading to theft, violence and drug-related crimes. Could better mental health care and early intervention reduce crime? I would like to explore this connection and use data science to find solutions that can improve public safety and mental health outcomes.

## Hypotheses
**1. H₀:** There is no relationship between untreated mental illness, drug use, and crime rates.  
**H₁:** Higher rates of undiagnosed mental illnesses are connected with increased use of drugs and this in turn contributes to higher crime rates.  
**2. H₀:** The availability of mental health care services has no effect on drug use rates.  
**H₁:** Areas with limited access to mental health services have significantly higher drug use rates  
**3. H₀:** The severity of untreated mental health disorders does not influence the likelihood of criminal behavior.  
**H₁:** Individuals with severe, untreated mental health conditions are more likely to engage in criminal activity.  

## Data Sources
**-** National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) — Mental health statistics and treatment access.  
**-** Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) — Drug use and addiction trends.  
**-** FBI Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program — Crime data, including drug-related offenses.  
**-** CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) — Mental health and substance use data.  
**-** State-Level Mental Health Facility Data — Availability of mental health services.  

## Analysis Plan
**1.** Data Collection and Cleaning — Merging mental health, drug use and crime data from different sources.  
**2.** Exploratory Data Analysis — Visualizing relationships between mental health struggles, drug use and crime.  
**3.** Statistical Analysis —  
**-** Correlation tests to see if lack of mental health care leads to more drug use.  
**-** Models to predict crime rates based on mental health and substance abuse data.  
**-** Hypothesis testing.  
**4.** Findings and Improvements — Identifying patterns and discussing potential solutions.  

## Expected Findings
**-** Higher drug abuse rates in areas with poor mental healthcare access.  
**-** Stronger correlation between drug use and crime where mental health struggles are untreated.  
**-** Expanding mental health services could help reduce drug-related crimes.  

## Future Work and Improvements
**-** Expand the dataset by incorporating additional factors like income, level of education and healthcare policies.  
**-** Apply machine learning techniques to better predict crime trends based on mental health and drug use patterns.  
**-** Investigate rehabilitation programs to see if access to mental health support reduces crime rates in the long run.
